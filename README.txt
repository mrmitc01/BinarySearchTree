BinarySearchTree

This code is used to implement a binary search tree data structure and the major functions associated with it

The purposes of each of the following files are stated below:


binarySearchTree.py - to output one of three different datasets formatted as an array, create a tree from this dataset, 
                      search the tree for a value and indicate whether it exists in the tree, output the node's value 
                      and the values of its left child, right child, and parent; also output the maximum and minimum values
                      in the tree, the tree traversed in order, the tree traversed in pre order, the tree traversed in post
                      order, and the tree with a node deleted traversed in order
data - a folder containing three datasets, each of which has a column of values; only one of these datasets is used in the 
       program; if a different data is desired, simply change the name of the csv file at the top of the code in file = open()
  - test1.csv
  - test2.csv
  - test3.csv


Compile the source code by typing the following at the prompt $:
$ python binarySearchTree.py
